Lab 3B: File System Consistency Analysis

Included File:
    - lab3.py
        Python 3 file that takes in a CSV describing a filesystem and runs analysis on inconsistancies
    - Makefile
        Makefile to create executable lab3b, as well as a tar distribution (dist), a series of tests (check)
        and clean the working directory (clean) 
    - README
        A text file containing a description of program functionality
    - tests.sh
        A shell script to download and run a series of checks on lab3.py
    
Usage:
    The program will take in the given CSV file, representing the contents of a filesystem.
    The program then analyzes the filesystem to check for corruption. 

    Sample usage:
        ./lab3b <CSV FILE>

    Output:
        INVALID BLOCK ? IN INODE ? AT OFFSET ?
            - Block beyond the range of the filesystem was referenced
        RESERVED BLOCK ? IN INODE ? AT OFFSET ?
            - Block reserved for system use was referenced
        UNREFERENCED BLOCK ?
            - Block doesn't exist on the free list or pointed to by any inode
        ALLOCATED BLOCK ? ON FREELIST
            - Block is both pointed to by an inode and the freelist
        DUPLICATE BLOCK ? IN INODE ? AT OFFSET ?
            - Block is pointed to by multiple inodes
        ALLOCATED INODE ? ON FREELIST
            - Inode both is allocated and marked as free
        UNALLOCATED INODE ? NOT ON FREELIST
            - Inode isn't allocated but not marked as free
        INODE ? HAS ? LINKS BUT LINKCOUNT IS ?
            - Discrepency between the amount of links to an inode and 
            how many directories reference inconsistancies
        DIRECTORY INODE ? NAME 'directory name' UNALLOCATED INODE ?
            - Directory entry points to an unallocated inode
        DIRECTORY INODE ? NAME 'directory name' INVALID INODE ?
            - Directory entry points to an invalid inode (outside the system)
        DIRECTORY INODE ? NAME '..' LINK TO INODE ? SHOULD BE ?
            - Directory '..' doesn't point to parent
        DIRECTORY INODE ? NAME '.' LINK TO INODE ? SHOULD BE ?
            - Directory '.' doesn't point to itself
    
    Return Codes:
        - 0: Success, no inconsistancies found
        - 1: Failure, bad parameters or system call failure
        - 2: Success, inconsistencies found

Features and Limitations:
    The program has potential to be expanded to work with multiple groups, with
    reasonably little modification. In addition, by creative usage of python 3
    containers, nearly all lookups occur in O(1) time, meaning that overall time
    complexity is on the order of O(N logN) or O(N). In addition, the csv file
    provided is only read into memory one time, reducing system calls and overhead
